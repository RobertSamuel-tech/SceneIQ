# Multi-object tracking and motion analysis settings

tracking:
  persist: true               # Maintain track IDs across frames
  min_scene_appearances: 2    # Minimum frames a track_id must appear to be stable
  min_scene_count: 3          # Minimum scenes a track_id must appear in to be "main character"
  motion_action_threshold: 1.2  # Average track speed (norm coords / s) → "action" scene type

movement_labels:
  person_run_speed: 1.8       # Normalised speed threshold: walking → running
  person_walk_speed: 0.6      # Normalised speed threshold: static → walking
  vehicle_speed: 1.5          # Normalised speed threshold: parked → moving
  ball_fast_speed: 2.0        # Normalised speed threshold: slow → fast ball

frame_sampler:
  max_frames: 180             # Hard frame cap — keeps CPU time bounded
  high_motion_hz: 2.0         # Sampling rate (fps) during high-motion segments
  normal_motion_hz: 1.0       # Sampling rate during normal motion
  static_hz: 0.5              # Sampling rate during static scenes
  high_motion_threshold: 15.0 # Inter-frame pixel diff mean → high motion
  low_motion_threshold: 5.0   # Inter-frame pixel diff mean → low motion
